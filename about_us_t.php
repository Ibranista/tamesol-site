                The owner was first exposed to the industry through
                weekend trips to job sites with her father, a successful
                commercial general contractor. She joined his company at
                14, performing secretarial duties and learning the nuances
                of estimating multi-million dollar commercial projects.
                Although she enjoyed her work at a thriving construction
                company, she chose to pursue a career in pediatric
                medicine. Still, her heart never left the trades. In 2009 she
                re-entered the construction scene in D.C, dually seeing
                patients and swinging a hammer for almost a decade.
